<h1>The Best Movies according to Boma</h1>
<h2>My top 4 Movies of all-time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Novoland: Eagle's Flag</h3>
<p>This is movie explains the history and 
    covenant between the Northen part of 
    China and the Southern part. The Movie
    rotates around three main characters.
    I have seen this movie over 2 times, and
    it is not just a movie, it is series of
    over 40 episodes.
</p>

<h2>Game of Thrones</h2>
<p>This series tells the Game between 
    of different classes, and the fight to
    sit on the iron throne. Though it ended
    in a sad note, Jon Snaow killed the
    Dragon Queen, who fought to sit on 
    the throne.

<h2>Battle Through the Heavens</h2>
<p>The most sought after Chinese Anime
    I can watch this anime anything and 
    don't feel bored.

<h2>Renegade Immortal</h2>
<p>The baddest Chinese Anime ever. You can 
    never the bored with this anime. As of the 
    day I am writing this, I am watching the 
    126th episode. It is GOAT.
